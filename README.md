Documentation and resources for a WebCats (Category Theory) [W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/). We are discussing some ideas in Gitter here.

Some ideas of discussion topics of a WebCats CG:

* [RDF literature](RDF/Literature.md)
* HTTP as coalgebras
* Query Languages in CT: Sparql, CQL, ...
* Modal Logics

At present we are still considering wether github is the
right place to put a the CG as github does not support mathematical notation for issues, which would be very useful. See the [webcats github repository](https://github.com/webcats).
