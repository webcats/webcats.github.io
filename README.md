Documentation and resources for a potential [WebCats](https://www.w3.org/community/groups/)  W3C Community Group on linking Web technologies and Category Theory. We are discussing some ideas in Gitter here.

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/webcats/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) 

Some potential discussion topics for a WebCats CG:

* [CT interpretations of RDF](RDF/Literature.md)
* HTTP interpreted coalgebraically or in terms of Categories of Games
* Query Languages formalisations: Sparql, CQL, [ShEx](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/ShEx)
* Modal Logics, Monads, ... to allow formalisation of reasoning about access control
* ...

At present we are still considering wether github is the
right place to put such a CG as github does not support mathematical notation for issues, which would be very useful. See the [webcats github repository](https://github.com/webcats).
